## **Features**  
- Extracts and processes content from up to five URLs.  
- Splits and stores text in an optimized vector database using FAISS.  
- Enables semantic search for retrieving the most relevant text chunks.  
- Generates accurate answers via OpenAI's GPT model.  
- Cost-efficient by optimizing API token usage.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**: Core programming language.  
- **LangChain**: For text chunking and query chains.  
- **OpenAI GPT**: For generating insightful answers.  
- **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**: Vector database for fast, semantic search.  
- **Streamlit**: Interactive front-end interface.

## **Getting Started**  

### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later  
- pip (Python package manager)  
- API key for OpenAI  

### **Installation**  
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ferozk0333/FinSight-Financial-Research-Assistant-with-LangChain-and-OpenAI.git
   cd FinSight-Financial-Research-Assistant-with-LangChain-and-OpenAI
   ```
2. Install Dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up OpenAI API Key:
   Ideally, create a .env file in the project directory and add:
   ```bash
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```
4. Run app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

## **Technical Architecture**  
### **Data Flow**
- **Document Loader**: Extracts article content and metadata from URLs.
- **Text Splitter**: Splits content into smaller, overlapping chunks using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.
- **Vector Embedding**: Converts text chunks into embeddings via HuggingFace SentenceTransformers.
- **Vector Database**: Stores embeddings in FAISS for fast similarity search.
- **Query Processing**: Fetches relevant chunks and sends them to OpenAI for answering the user query.
